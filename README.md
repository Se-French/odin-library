Create the beginings of a library app.

Store all of the books in an array to be displayed on the page in the form of cards with another function. The UI has a button to bring up a form to add another book to the library (this part is not fully functional yet). There is also a button which will remove a book from both the library and the array. Each book card also has a button to change the read status of the book.

This is a project from the Odin Project which requires the use of object constructors and knowledge of objects.
